Style Guides

RESEARCH:

The programming language I am using for this Style Guide is HTML. I used HTML in the HTML and CSS class last semester and I really enjoyed it. 
I found that HTML was a good mix of both programming language and english. I read through the style guide on this website. 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp. From reading one thing i did not know was that you do not have to close all elements. 
For example the <p> element does not need a </p> element to close it. Though it is recommended. One thing I also didn't know was everything the <title> element did. 
I knew how to use it, but didnt know all it did. IT provides a title for the page when its added to favorites. That I didn't know. 

REFLECT:
	
	HTML is something I enjoy doing! Since finishing the HTML and CSS class last semester I find myself still messing around and making website landing pages just for fun.
  I Still need to know a bit. As google has been my friend. I struggle with remembering certain things. Mainly in the CSS. That's where I forget most things. 
  I remember a lot of HTML. And practicing it sure does help! Some things I need to work on is my tidiness. 
  I sometimes get carried away. And don't make my code very neat, in both HTML and CSS. I tend to just get carried away and have fun coding that i'm not thinking about it. 
  And I need to start making it second nature. So I don't need to think about it. 

MY HTML AND CSS EXAMPLES:

CSS: 
body {
    background-color:floralwhite;
}

nav{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    position: relative;
    float: right;
    z-index: 1;

}
.nav-links{
    text-align: right;
    background-color:teal;
    padding: 10px 30px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 18px;
    }



.nav-links ul li{
    list-style: none;
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 5px 25px;
}
.nav-links ul li a{
    color:#fff;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 18px;
}



HTML:
 <header>
        <nav>
            <img src="whitelogo.png" class="logo" alt="LTR LOGO">
        <div class="nav-links">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="About.html">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="Repairs.html">Repairs</a></li>
            <li><a href="quotes.html">Quotes</a></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    </nav>
    <div class="left-sidebar"></div>   
        <div class="row">
            <div class="left-col">
                <img src="TestImage.jpg" alt="test Image">
            </div>
            <div class="right-col">
                <h1 class="h1home">Kevin Leader</h1>
