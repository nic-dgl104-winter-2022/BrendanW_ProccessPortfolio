## Week 1

### RESEARCH

So, one site that I found for our textbook production is https://www.visme.co/. I decided to make an account on the website and see how it actually is. 
The site seems like it allows you to make any style of book you want. What I found is great with this site is all the already made templates it offers. 
There seems to be a lot of style! And it seems like it would be really easy to make a good functional unique textbook. Not only does it allow text. 
But It has options for graphics and animated objects! The one con I see with this. And it could be similar to other platforms. Its nice to have all the template options. 
And the choice of personalizing the textbook. But with everyone working on different parts we would have to make sure we don't all go “too crazy” and make a textbook that 
clearly looks like 30 people did it. So all the options they have are both a pro, but could also be a con. The editing system on this site seems extremely user 
friendly from what I have been noticing with my time on the site. Of course with most sites there is a “upgrade” option that allows you to get more 
illustration, templates, and more. So not having every option you want without upgrading is a con i would say. Another issue is I'm not sure if we all make different 
pages and how to put it all together. We may have to download our pages individually then put them together on another site. So that is another flow with this site. 
It's a builder. Not a publishing site. 


### REFLECT

From past textbooks I really dislike having tons of information on one page. Having to much text per page can make everything seem very overwhelming.
And I personally find it hard to focus when I also see all the other reading that has to be done on that page. I really like textbooks that have 
vocabulary words on the sides of pages. This makes it very easy to find the vocab word you need right away. I also like when textbooks have everything nicely labeled
in sections. This makes it very easy to go from section to section.


## Week 2

### RESEARCH

The programming language I am using for this Style Guide is HTML. I used HTML in the HTML and CSS class last semester and I really enjoyed it. 
I found that HTML was a good mix of both programming language and english. I read through the style guide on this website. 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp. From reading one thing i did not know was that you do not have to close all elements. 
For example the <p> element does not need a </p> element to close it. Though it is recommended. One thing I also didn't know was everything the <title> element did. 
I knew how to use it, but didnt know all it did. IT provides a title for the page when its added to favorites. That I didn't know.

	
### REFLECT
	HTML is something I enjoy doing! Since finishing the HTML and CSS class last semester 
	I find myself still messing around and making website landing pages just for fun.
  I Still need to know a bit. As google has been my friend. I struggle with remembering certain things. Mainly in the CSS. That's where I forget most things. 
  I remember a lot of HTML. And practicing it sure does help! Some things I need to work on is my tidiness. 
  I sometimes get carried away. And don't make my code very neat, in both HTML and CSS. I tend to just get carried away and have fun coding that i'm not thinking about it. 
  And I need to start making it second nature. So I don't need to think about it.
