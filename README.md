RELFECT:

From past extbooks i really dislike having tons of information on one page. Having to much text per page can make eveyrthing seem very overwhelming.
And i personally find it hard to docus when i also see all the other reading that has to be done on that page. I really like textbooks that have 
vocabulary words on the sides of pages. This makes it very easy to find the covab word you need right away. I also like when text books have everything nicely labaled
in sections. This makes it very easy to go to section to section.

RESEARCH:
 
So, one site that I found for our textbook production is https://www.visme.co/. I decided to make an account on the website and see how it actually is. 
The site seems like it allows you to make any style of book you want. What I found is great with this site is all the already made templates it offers. 
There seems to be a lot of style! And it seems like it would be really easy to make a good functional unique textbook. Not only does it allow text. 
But It has options for graphics and animated objects! The one con I see with this. And it could be similar to other platforms. Its nice to have all the template options. 
And the choice of personalizing the textbook. But with everyone working on different parts we would have to make sure we don't all go “too crazy” and make a textbook that 
clearly looks like 30 people did it. So all the options they have are both a pro, but could also be a con. The editing system on this site seems extremely user 
friendly from what I have been noticing with my time on the site. Of course with most sites there is a “upgrade” option that allows you to get more 
illustration, templates, and more. So not having every option you want without upgrading is a con i would say. Another issue is I'm not sure if we all make different 
pages and how to put it all together. We may have to download our pages individually then put them together on another site. So that is another flow with this site. 
It's a builder. Not a publishing site.
