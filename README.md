## Week 1

### RESEARCH

So, one site that I found for our textbook production is https://www.visme.co/. I decided to make an account on the website and see how it actually is. 
The site seems like it allows you to make any style of book you want. What I found is great with this site is all the already made templates it offers. 
There seems to be a lot of style! And it seems like it would be really easy to make a good functional unique textbook. Not only does it allow text. 
But It has options for graphics and animated objects! The one con I see with this. And it could be similar to other platforms. Its nice to have all the template options. 
And the choice of personalizing the textbook. But with everyone working on different parts we would have to make sure we don't all go “too crazy” and make a textbook that 
clearly looks like 30 people did it. So all the options they have are both a pro, but could also be a con. The editing system on this site seems extremely user 
friendly from what I have been noticing with my time on the site. Of course with most sites there is a “upgrade” option that allows you to get more 
illustration, templates, and more. So not having every option you want without upgrading is a con i would say. Another issue is I'm not sure if we all make different 
pages and how to put it all together. We may have to download our pages individually then put them together on another site. So that is another flow with this site. 
It's a builder. Not a publishing site. 


### REFLECT

From past textbooks I really dislike having tons of information on one page. Having to much text per page can make everything seem very overwhelming.
And I personally find it hard to focus when I also see all the other reading that has to be done on that page. I really like textbooks that have 
vocabulary words on the sides of pages. This makes it very easy to find the vocab word you need right away. I also like when textbooks have everything nicely labeled
in sections. This makes it very easy to go from section to section.


## Week 2

### RESEARCH

The programming language I am using for this Style Guide is HTML. I used HTML in the HTML and CSS class last semester and I really enjoyed it. 
I found that HTML was a good mix of both programming language and english. I read through the style guide on this website. 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp. From reading one thing i did not know was that you do not have to close all elements. 
For example the <p> element does not need a </p> element to close it. Though it is recommended. One thing I also didn't know was everything the <title> element did. 
I knew how to use it, but didnt know all it did. IT provides a title for the page when its added to favorites. That I didn't know.

	
### REFLECT
  HTML is something I enjoy doing! Since finishing the HTML and CSS class last semester 
  I find myself still messing around and making website landing pages just for fun.
  I Still need to know a bit. As google has been my friend. I struggle with remembering certain things. Mainly in the CSS. That's where I forget most things. 
  I remember a lot of HTML. And practicing it sure does help! Some things I need to work on is my tidiness. 
  I sometimes get carried away. And don't make my code very neat, in both HTML and CSS. I tend to just get carried away and have fun coding that i'm not thinking about it. 
  And I need to start making it second nature. So I don't need to think about it.

## Week 3
	
### RESEARCH
	
API Stands for Application Programming Interface. Which really means “rules of engagement”. 
This allows software applications to interact with other programs.
I have been browsing through [Java Guide](https://www.javaguides.net/p/java-api-guides-java-core-packages-api.html)
the website seems to be laid out very well. It's easy to find what i'm looking for, it has many different “packages” that 
allow the user to read more about what they want.

A few APIs that may be helpful to some apps are
[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries)
[Weather Map](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/weather-api/?gclid=Cj0KCQiArt6PBhCoARIsAMF5wah2R9OHmDG1uCztmt6tZ3WLZRwaeYlN-vBkDtTlv38NnelLmBE8FpMaAsj9EALw_wcB)
	
### REFLECT
	
The only experience i can think of is from this semester in my "Javascript" class. I find that i have to do a better job at remembering all the rules of Java.
I seem to understand what Java is. And how everything works. Its just rememeber how to write it down to allow it to be effective.
	


## WEEK 4
	
### RESEARCH
	The community i have found is "Free Code Camp" On github. I have chose this community because i love how it gives info and and code
	on how you can improve your coding. It pretty much has code to seach you how to code. Another reason i like it is becuase it has more then 
	just JavaScript. It also have HTML and CSS. Two thing i am more familiar with! But also two thing i really wanna learn more about!
	This community doesnt seem to have a central hub like discord or slacked. What they do have is a website.
	with a forum to communicate and ask questions with others in the community. They have a few ways to be able to help contribute.
	
	Help by answering coding questions on our community forum.
 	Give feedback on coding projects built by campers.
 	Help us translate freeCodeCamp.org's resources.
 	Contribute to our open source codebase on GitHub.
	
	So ill test myself and see if i am able to help with any of the coding questions in the community forum!
	
	
### REFLECT
	Im excited to get going in this community. I really like that it almost has "classes" so i can learn more about JavaScript.
	The github has many recourses so i can research specific parts of JavaScript. And also has code that goes along with it.
	My goals are to try to get through the Java section. Hoping ill further understand it. Ill try to help in the community
	with questions in the forums.

	
## WEEK 5
	
### RESEARCH
	The IDE I have chosen for this is Visual Studio Code. I started using Visual Studio Code last semester for my HTML and CSS class.
	It seems to be very easy to use! And very user friendly! Im very fimilar with it. And honestly its the only one ive use. So i feel
	safe using it. I love the multi colours. Words having different colours allows you to better understand whats connected to what.
	
### REFLECT
	Ive defiantly been stuck with debugging before. Specifically with Visual Studio Code. A few assignments in my Javascript class i was stuck.
	And Visual Studio Code didnt seem to help me very much with the debugging and figruing out what was wrong. It gave me a indication that something
	was wrong. But i still wasnt able to figure out what specicially was wrong about it. 

	
## WEEK 6
	
### RESEARCH
	I was taking a look at this website that breaks down a few "good" and "bad" code reviews. It states that a lot of erroes are found it "breaking the generally accepted architecture", "bugs consisting in incorrect handling of all edge cases", and "errors in the logic of our application". They say in a unresolved conflict error. This is what takes place.
"Checker: reports a problem with the name of the attempt method, suggesting to use getter or getAttempt (),
Author: Disagrees with this suggestion, stating that getter is used when a process actually fetches data from another source rather than directly returning data from an object.
Checker: inserts links to pages presenting examples of using the getAttempt () methods in this case,
Author: replies with links to sources confirming his approach."
	
A good example of resolving a conflict is this 
"Checker: reports a problem with the name of the attempt method, suggesting to use getter or getAttempt (),
Author: disagrees with this suggestion, stating that getter is used when a process actually fetches data from another source, rather than directly returning data from an object.
Checker: agrees with the author of the code, but points out that it is better to name such methods so that they indicate the actual functionality. This way, eventually the method name is changed to numberOfAttepmts ()."

	
## WEEK 7
### COMMUNITY CODE
	
	This week i have decided to write about the community code that i have done. Im going to be 
	honest and say i have not done anything specifically towards my community. 
	Since i chose "freecodecamp" as my community ive actually been going through to tutorials
	they have for JavaScript. And try to get better and what i struggle with in Java. 
	There are over 100 different lessions they allow you to actually do the Javascript. 
	So i read about it, then attemp to do the code! I am attempting to do 10 lessons a week! 
	Although the start can be very boring. It is nice to get some repetition with javascript! 
	And even though i already know how to do most of it so far. Its nice to atleast
	be able to do the writing and not just readying. So im memorizing how to write it down!
	
	Heres some example of code i had to do to "Declare a Read-Only Variable with a const Keyword"
	Again. I already know how to do this. Its just nice to do it again for
	my terrible memories sake!
	
	...
	const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
	let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
	fact = "is awesome!";
	console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
	...
	.
	
## WEEK 8
### RESEARCH
	
	Since im trying to get myself more and more familiar with Javascript i took at looks
	at some links left by other students that involved Javascript. I took a look at a link
	left my Anna. [Java Style Guide](https://my.visme.co/view/dmy7ezjv-javascript-style-guides-2).
	What i like about this is the fun way everything if laid out! Its very straight forward
	and easy to follow. It tells you the best ways to name your variables, code indentation, and
	it even has a reminder for how to link your Javascript to your HTML. Which it GREAT, even the
	simpalist of things can be over looked and easily forgotten. All and all i really like this site.
	It doesnt go to crazy in depth. But it does good reminding you of the simple things you may forget
	if you dont code to often. 
	
	The next one i took a look at is the [Javascript guide from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines/JavaScript)
	This was linked by Trevor. I like this one because it seems to have a TON of information. It has
	links to send you to whatever you would like to know about. It gives great descriptions.
	And even clear examples on how to write the specific code. 
	
### REFLECT
	
	I chose both these style guides to look at because they relate to what i want to learn about most.
	Im trying to sharpen up on my Javascript. And get it to the same level of my HTML and CSS.
	Both descriptions left by my fellow students were exteremly positive. And both sites didnt
	disappoint. What i like about both of them is that they are different but similar. The first
	site left by Anna is a more simplistic site. That seems to focus on the main and simple stuff
	that some people can easily forget! The second site left from Trevor is great because it goes
	more indepth on EVERYTHING. And it has great examples to help you out!
	
	Pros from both is that they are both very well laid out. They both cover what they are trying
	to cover very well. They both cover the topic of Javascript differently, but both do it very well.
	Cons for the first site would be that it doesnt elaborate on more topics. It seems to specifically
	focus on the "easy" forgettable parts of javascript. A con for the second site is that it just jumps
	straight into the topics. It doesnt seems to have a nice introduction page with the basics on it.
	
	Overally i like both sites! And will 100% be saving them to look back on when i need a hand 
	or i forget something thats "simple" :)

	
	## WEEK 9
	### RESEARCH
	A useful website for UI patters is https://ui-patterns.com/. This site has tons of pattern examples
	for almost anything! What awesome about it is that i have the problem at hand. Followed by a quick
	example about it. It has a usage section explaining how the user would use it. Followed by a solution
	section to help you come to the solution
	
	### REFLECT
	One app that i use often is instagram. I probably use instagram the most out of any app on my phone.
	I personally like instagrams UI, as it is simple and very easy to use! But here is a quick pros and
	cons list to this lovely and famous UI.
	
	Pros - The app seems to have a very easy layout. It has the name at the top, followed by a posting 
	option, your likes, and dms. On the bottom it has 5 options. home page, search, reels, shop, and
	profile. I really like the simplicity of the profile screen. Not a lot going on. Very simple.
	Logo, name, and then a description. No banner photo. Which i think gives it a very clean look.
	
	
	Cons - One con i find is that since they added reel and shops. Their are to many options on the bottom
	of the screen. Another is there are a lot of hiden options. And if you are new to instagram it can be
	easy to get lost. For example the "post" button. Just looks like a square with a plus. When you click it
	it shoes 4 more options. Post, story, reel, or live. You have no idea those options are there unless
	you click on the icon.
